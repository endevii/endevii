## Hi, I’m @endevii
I'm interested in **music production** as well as developing mini apps/programs utilizing various languages/libraries.

Currently into **Web Development**, mainly since it is easy to make prototypes very quickly. Have used **React**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind**, **Redis**, **Redux**, **Apollo**

Current Classes: **Concurrent Programming**, **Database Management Systems II**, **Intro to Cloud Computing**, **Senior Design II**

Next Semester: **Potential Grad student !?**
